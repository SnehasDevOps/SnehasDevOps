- **Creativity in Automation** 🎨 - Bringing unique ideas to make DevOps workflows both powerful and elegant.

### My DevOps Toolbox 🧰
Throughout my DevOps journey, I've gained hands-on experience with a range of industry-demanded tools, including:

### Outside of DevOps 💡
When I’m not in DevOps mode, you’ll probably find me with my camera 📸, capturing moments—from nature to cityscapes, and everything in between. Art and creativity fuel my passion, and I bring that same creativity into my DevOps work.

### Fun Fact 😄
*Guilty pleasure:* I can get lost in the world of social media scrolling 📱—but I’m working on spending more time on my art and creative projects!
